= gobump

`gobump` bumps up program version by rewriting `version`-like variable/constant values in the Go source code following http://semver.org/[SemVer].

== USAGE

    Usage: gobump (major|minor|patch|up|set <version>|show) [-w] [-v] [<path>]

    Commands:
      major             bump major version up
      minor             bump minor version up
      patch             bump patch version up
      up                bump up with prompt
      set <version>     set exact version (no increments)
      show              only show the versions (implies -v)

    Flags:
      -v=false: show the resulting version values
      -w=false: write result to (source) file instead of stdout

== EXAMPLE

Suppose you have a source file:

[source,go]
----
package main

const version = "2.3.4" // must follow semver spec
----

If you run

    gobump minor

you will get:

[source,go]
----
package main

const version = "2.4.0"
----

Use `-w` to rewrite the file in-place.

Other options:

    gobump major     # 2.3.4 -> 3.0.0
    gobump minor     # 2.3.4 -> 2.4.0
    gobump patch     # 2.3.4 -> 2.3.5
    gobump set 5.5.5 # 2.3.4 -> 5.5.5
